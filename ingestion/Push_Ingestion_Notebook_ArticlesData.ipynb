    "+ Create an index schema\n",
    "+ Load the sample data from a local folder\n",
    "+ Embed the documents in-memory using Azure OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large model\n",
    "+ Index the vector and nonvector fields on Azure AI Search\n",
    "+ Run a series of vector and hybrid queries, including metadata filtering and hybrid (text + vectors) search. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code uses Azure OpenAI to generate embeddings for title and content fields. You'll need access to Azure OpenAI to run this demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code reads the `articles_1000.json` file, which contains the input data for which embeddings need to be generated.\n",

    "## Prerequisites\n",

    "+ A deployment of the text-embedding-3-large embedding model.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Azure AI Search, any tier, but choose a service that has sufficient capacity for your vector index. We recommend Basic or higher. [Enable semantic ranking](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/search/semantic-how-to-enable-disable) if you want to run the hybrid query with semantic ranking.\n",
